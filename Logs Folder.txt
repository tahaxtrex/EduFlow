1- first step was to ask chat gpt to generate the best prompt to achieve the end goal of the 
hackathon as the ai on itself is the best qualified to generate the best prompt that it can feed 
itself, 
This strategy allows us to exploit the model’s meta-prompting abilities: by generating the 
instructions it will later follow, the system reduces prompt misalignment, improves consistency, 
and produces higher-quality outputs across the entire pipeline.​
 
THE PROMPT :​
​
(give me the best prompt to give to an llm like gpt 5.1, that allows us to ask him the following :  
in a structured way similar to duolingo, and brilliant website, the website starts asking questions 
like in a select the answer format , what is the purpose of learning , level of education or status , 
then what is the level of the user in that specific topic , this should be stored  and based on 
these informations, the ai should be able to generate a full web page with all the course 
material, sectioned in structured way, following the academic standard of teaching, it should 
contain graphs, pictures, examples , analogies for better understanding of the user , you can 
come up with ideas to improve in the point is to follow the instructions and win the hackathon, )

PROJECT OVERVIEW 
Build a website where a learner: 

1.​ Selects or answers a sequence of adaptive questions (Duolingo/Brilliant style): 
○​ “What is your purpose for learning this topic?” 
○​ “What is your current education level?” 
○​ “What is your level in this topic?” 
○​ Additional questions you generate to improve personalization. 

2.​ The system stores these answers in a database. 
3.​ The AI generates a complete custom course, including: 

○​ course overview 
○​ modules 
○​ lessons 
○​ worked examples 
○​ analogies 
○​ scientific illustrations (generated using prompts) 
○​ inline graphs (ASCII or rendered) 
○​ a glossary 
○​ quizzes & assessments 
○​ final project or challenge 

4.​ The website displays this course as a dynamic learning page with clean structure, 
navigation, and visuals. 

1. UI / UX 
Your output must generate a complete UI that includes: 

A. Landing Page 

●​ Hero section with animations 
●​ input field for the topic for learning 
●​ "Generate Your Custom Course" button 
●​ Examples of courses 
●​ Clean visuals (Brilliant-style) 



B. Adaptive Questionnaire (Duolingo style) 

●​ 1 question per screen 
●​ Multiple-choice buttons 
●​ Smooth animations 
●​ Progress indicator 
●​ Example questions: 

○​ “Why do you want to learn X?” 
○​ “What’s your current skill level in X?” 
○​ “What’s your preferred learning style?” 
○​ “What is your education background?” 

C. Course Generation Screen 

●​ Loading animation 
●​ Course preview 
●​ Navigation sidebar 
●​ Download PDF button 

D. Final Course Page 

Structured as: 

Module 1: Title 
    - Lesson 1: Explanation, examples, images, analogies 
    - Lesson 2: Exercises 
Module 2: ... 
Assessments 
Glossary 
Project 
References 
 
 

Generate a complete course structure and one detailed lesson for the topic "Machine 
Learning (ML)", strictly following these instructions. 

 

PHASE 1 — COURSE STRUCTURE 
(MANDATORY) 



Produce a course structure with: 

●​ Exactly 3 modules​
 

●​ Maximum 3 lessons per module​
 

●​ Maximum 7 lessons total across the entire course​
 

Each module must include: 

●​ Module title​
 

●​ 2–3 lessons, each with:​
 

○​ Lesson Title​
 

○​ 1-sentence lesson objective​
 

The course must be designed for: 

●​ High-school students​
 

●​ With basic math knowledge​
 

●​ Who are learning ML for school​
 

●​ Tone: friendly, encouraging, simple, and academically correct​
 

 

PHASE 2 — all the prompts required 
 

    const prompt = ` 

    Analyze the following learner profile: 

    Topic: ${responses.topic} 

    Purpose: ${responses.purpose} 



    Education Level: ${responses.education} 

    Current Knowledge: ${responses.level} 

    Learning Style: ${responses.style} 

   

    Create a "Persona Summary" JSON object with: 

    - summary: A brief description of the learner. 

    - tone: Recommended tone (e.g., "Encouraging and simple" or "Academic 
and rigorous"). 

    - complexity: Level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). 

  `; 

 

 const prompt = ` 

    Create a course structure for "${topic}" tailored to this persona: 
${JSON.stringify(persona)}. 

    

    Output a JSON object with: 

    - title: Creative course title. 

    - description: Course overview. 

    - modules: Array of objects { title: "Module Title", lessons: [ { 
title: "Lesson Title" } ] } 

    

    Limit to 3 modules, with max 3 lessons each. a max of 7 lessons 
overall. 

  `; 

 



 

const prompt = ` 

    Generate a COMPREHENSIVE and DETAILED lesson for: 

    Course: ${courseTitle} 

    Module: ${moduleTitle} 

    Lesson: ${lessonTitle} 

    Target Audience: ${persona.summary} (${persona.complexity})
