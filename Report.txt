GenAI Course Builder – System Report 
(PDF/Markdown Submission) 

1. Overview 
This report documents the logic, prompting strategy, reasoning steps, and evaluation 
mechanisms used in the AI Course Generation Pipeline. The system uses OpenAI’s 
chat-completions API to generate complete instructional content, from learner persona modeling 
to full course modules, lessons, media prompts, assessments, glossary terms, and usage 
summaries. 

The pipeline is designed to transform a high-level topic + user profile into a structured, 
pedagogically aligned learning experience. 

 

2. GenAI Interaction Logic (System 
Architecture) 
The pipeline follows a multi-stage sequential reasoning flow: 

Pipeline Stages 

1.​ Persona Generation 
2.​ Course Structure Generation 
3.​ Lesson Expansion 
4.​ Project, Glossary, Final Assessment Generation 
5.​ Final Assembly + Output 

Each stage feeds structured JSON back into the next stage, creating a controlled and auditable 
generation process. 

Data Flow Diagram 
User Responses  → generatePersona → Persona   
Persona + Topic → generateStructure → Course Structure   
Persona + Structure → expandCourseContent → Full Lessons   



Course Title + Persona → generateExtras → Assessments & Glossary   
Merge All → Final Course Object 
 

Models Used 

All generations call: 

model: "gpt-4o" 
response_format: { type: "json_object" } 
 

This ensures: 

●​ deterministic JSON structure 
●​ predictable parsing 
●​ reduced hallucinations 
●​ minimized post-processing errors 

 

3. Reasoning Steps Used in Pipeline 
Execution 
Global System Strategy 
Here we have chosen to break down the prompting pipeline into 5 different steps that allows us 
to ensure that we are giving the LLM a reasonable workload, expecting the least amount of 
hallucinations and most accurate answers possible. 

 

1.​ Iterative Deepening​
Each stage produces structured data consumed by the next, preventing drifting or 
context loss. 

2.​ JSON Output Normalization​
Every prompt uses response_format: { type: "json_object" } to prevent 
malformed or incomplete outputs. 

3.​ Persona Conditioning​
Persona data is included in every stage, ensuring: 

○​ tone consistency 
○​ level-appropriate content 



○​ coherent difficulty scaling 
4.​ Pedagogical Constraints​

The system uses explicit educational principles: 
○​ scaffolded progression 
○​ multimodal explanation (examples, analogies, graphs, images) 
○​ retrieval practice (quizzes) 
○​ project-based learning 

5.​ Iterative Module/Lesson Looping​
The system loops over module and lesson arrays to ensure coverage and to allow for 
parallelization if needed. 

 
 

4. Prompting Strategy and Pipeline Details 
Below is a breakdown of all 5 core prompt categories, their goals, and design rationale. Write 
the reason 

 

4.1 Persona Generation Prompt 
Function: generatePersona() 

Purpose:​
Build a compact but pedagogically informative persona object to condition downstream 
generations. 

Key Elements Extracted: 

●​ learner summary 
●​ recommended tone 
●​ complexity level 

Reasoning Strategy: 

●​ Forces the model to think like a “pedagogical analyst.” 
●​ Encodes user data into instructional constraints that shape every later generation. 
●​ Reduces drift by explicitly defining tone + complexity early in the pipeline. 

 



4.2 Course Structure Prompt 
Function: generateStructure() 

Purpose:​
Produce the high-level instructional blueprint (title → modules → lessons). 

Constraints: 

●​ 3 modules max 
●​ 3 lessons per module 
●​ Max 7 lessons total 
●​ JSON structure enforced 

Reasoning Strategy:​
By forcing structure before content, the system avoids: 

●​ rambling lesson generation 
●​ inconsistent depth 
●​ uneven module sizes 
●​ missing or duplicated lessons 
●​ Fulfilling the requirements 

Persona JSON is embedded to contextualize difficulty and tone. 

 

4.3 Lesson Expansion Prompt 
Function: generateLessonContent() 

Purpose:​
Transform lesson titles into full instructional content. 

Outputs: 

●​ explanation (Markdown format) 
●​ examples (2) 
●​ analogies (2) 
●​ images (array of image prompts) 
●​ graphs (structured data for visualization) 
●​ quiz items (MCQs with explanations) 

Formatting Rules Enforced: 



●​ Markdown 
●​ bolding 
●​ LaTeX for math 
●​ code blocks 
●​ tables 
●​ bullet lists 
●​ image prompts 
●​ graph schemas 

Reasoning Strategy:​
This is the most complex stage the system instructs GPT to generate multimodal-ready content 
while maintaining consistency with the persona and course-level context. 

 

4.4 Extras Generation Prompt 
Function: generateExtras() 

Purpose:​
Add: 

●​ final project 
●​ glossary 
●​ final assessment (5 questions) 
●​ usage metadata 

Reasoning Strategy:​
This ensures: 

●​ course consistency 
●​ final assessment coverage 
●​ a complete end-to-end learning experience 
●​ structured, JSON-valid outputs for LMS integration 

 

4.5 Full Course Assembly 
Function: generateCourse() 

The controller function orchestrates: 

●​ persona (stage 1) 



●​ structure (stage 2) 
●​ expanded lessons (stage 3) 
●​ extras (stage 4) 

…and merges them into one final JSON course package. 

Error logging provides transparency into pipeline failures.(debugging) 

 

5. Evaluation & Self-Checking 
Mechanisms 
While the current implementation does not include explicit self-checking prompts, the system 
uses several implicite valuation safeguards: 

1. JSON enforcement 

Prevents: 

●​ hallucinated fields 
●​ malformed data structures 
●​ inconsistencies in schema 

2. Persona-first approach 

Reduces: 

●​ tone drift 
●​ inappropriate difficulty 
●​ incoherent teaching style 

3. Structured prompt segmentation 

Each prompt handles a single tightly scoped task. 

This avoids: 

●​ mixed-intent responses 
●​ overlong or unfocused outputs 

4. Error Handling & Logging 



Console logs track: 

●​ module/lesson progress 
●​ generation failures 
●​ unexpected outputs 

5. Clear formatting rules 

Prevents: 

●​ long walls of text 
●​ inconsistent formatting 
●​ missing code/math/table blocks 

6. LMS-ready media representation 

Images and graphs are output as structured JSON metadata rather than raw binary. 

 

6. Conclusion 
The course generation service  pipeline is a well-structured, pedagogically aligned 
generative system designed to produce complete, multi-modal course content using a modular 
multi-stage pipeline. Its use of explicit personas, structured JSON outputs, and strict content 
formatting ensures high-quality, LMS-ready instructional material.
